# Data Analyst/Data Scientist Portfolio 
This is where I show my work.(please enter the repo to read the full description of the project)
## Stand-alone Projects
### [Airbnb Analysis Dashboard](https://github.com/Phil-avi/Airbnb-Covid-Analysis)
An interactive [dashboard](https://movie-recommendation-phil.herokuapp.com/) built with dash and plotly to study the impact of Covid-19 locakdowns on Airbnb hosts within Australia. this project utilised a fairly large dataset mainly scraped from Inside Airbnb. Dask was used for parallel processing and gunicorn was added as the WSGI server.

### [Movie Recommender Dashboard](https://github.com/Phil-avi/Movie-Recommender-Dashboard)
This repo contains a movie recommender [app](https://movie-recommendation-phil.herokuapp.com/) for showcasing an integrated recommendation model built with content-based filtering and collaborative filtering algorithms.

### [Medical Resources Geo-Mapping (Sierra Leone)](https://github.com/Phil-avi/SL-Site-Analysis-App) 
A geo mapping [template](https://sl-site-analysis.herokuapp.com/) I developed for Dove Air. This template was designed for our clients from Directorate of Science, Technology & Innovation (DSTI), Sierra Leone to visualise the medical resources distribution within the country and make data informed decisions.  

## Kaggle Competitions
### [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://github.com/Phil-avi/Titanic)
In this kernel, I experimented with some more advanced data transformation methods and explored some of the most popular classification models including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, k-nearest Neighbours, Gaussian, and Random Forest.

### [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://github.com/Phil-avi/House-Prices)
Several base models such as Lasso, KernelRidge, GradientBoostingRegressor, XGBRegressor, and LGBRegressor were explored and fine-tuned in this kernel. Additionally, two basic model stacking methods were also explored, resulting in the lowest rmse.
